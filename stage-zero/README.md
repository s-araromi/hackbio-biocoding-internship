# Stage Zero Submission - HackBio Biocoding Internship

This repository contains my submission for Stage Zero of the HackBio Biocoding Internship.

## Task Overview
The goal was to:
1. Organize personal information using R programming language
2. Use appropriate data structures
3. Avoid complex programming concepts (functions, loops, conditionals)
4. Create a clear print output
5. Document the solution in a GitHub repository

## Solution Approach

### Data Structure Choice
I used a **data frame** to organize the information because:
- It allows tabular organization of different data types
- Provides clear column-row structure
- Is native to R and easy to display
- Supports mixed data types (character strings, lists)

### Code Structure
- Direct value assignment without complex logic
- Single-row data frame containing:
  - Name
  - Slack username
  - Email
  - Hobby
  - Country
  - Academic discipline
  - Preferred programming language
- Final print statement for clean output

## Repository Structure
stage-zero/
├── s-araromi/
│ └── stage_zero.R
└── README.md

## How to Run
1. Ensure R is installed
2. Clone repository: `git clone [repo-url]`
3. Run script: `Rscript stage-zero/s-araromi/stage_zero.R`

## Output Explanation
The script will print:
- A formatted data frame showing all required information in a tabular format
- Column headers as specified fields
- Single row containing my personal details

## Compliance Check
- ✅ Used base R (no external packages)
- ✅ No functions/loops/conditionals
- ✅ Clear print statement
- ✅ All required fields included
- ✅ Markdown documentation
